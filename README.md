## 🚀 Project Overview

This project predicts the quality of red wine using machine learning, leveraging physicochemical characteristics from the UCI Wine Quality dataset. All analysis and code are contained within a single Jupyter notebook for clarity and reproducibility.

## 📑 Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* pip (or conda)

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-prediction.git
   cd wine-quality-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

*(Consider using a virtual environment for isolation.)*

## ✏️ Usage

All code resides in the Jupyter notebook. To run analyses and train models:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/wine_project.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the notebook cells in order. The notebook covers:

   * Loading and exploring the `winequality-red.csv` dataset
   * Preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling)
   * Training multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
   * Evaluating model performance (MAE, R²)
   * Visualizing results

## 🔍 Results

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 0.x
* **R² Score**: 0.y

Interactive plots and detailed analysis are available in the notebook.

## 🤝 Contributing
